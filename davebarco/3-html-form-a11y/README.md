Yes, I can help you improve a pre-existing survey form with accessibility (A11y) best practices. Here are a few things to consider:

    Use the label element to associate form controls with their corresponding labels, and make sure each label is unique and describes the purpose of the form control.

    Make sure the form controls can be accessed by keyboard, and that the tab order is logical and intuitive.

    Use fieldset and legend elements to group related form controls together and provide a clear visual hierarchy.

    Provide clear and concise instructions for each form control, and use ARIA attributes to further describe their purpose and behavior.

    Use the required attribute to indicate which form controls are mandatory and to validate the form accordingly.

    Provide clear and informative error messages for form validation errors, and make sure they are prominently displayed and easy to understand.

    Use the placeholder attribute to provide a short hint or example of the expected input in form fields where necessary

    Make sure that the contrast ratio of text and background colors used for your form is at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for larger text.

Here's an example of how a simple survey form might look like when using these A11y best practices:
