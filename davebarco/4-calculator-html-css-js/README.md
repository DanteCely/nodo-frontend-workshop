### I calculate that you must calculate a calculator code ðŸ§®

Choose one of them!

- Scientific Calculator
- Simple Calculator

Remember connect:

- HTML to <script> Javascript
- HTML to <styles> CSS

From document you can control everything

- [HTML DOM Events](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp)

The HTML I gave you creates the basic layout and buttons for the calculator, and each button has a corresponding JavaScript function call like "appendValue('1')" or "calculate()" that you can use to perform calculations.
However, you need to define those functions and make those functions to perform specific tasks like append number, add, subtract, divide, and multiply operations and etc.

Here's an example of how you might define those functions in JavaScript:

These functions provide the functionality to the calculator. appendValue is used to append the number to the currentValue, setOperator sets the operator, updateDisplay updates the display with the current value, clearDisplay clears the current value, operator and previous value. calculate function gets the result of the operation based on the operator and previous value and current value.

You need to include this javascript file in your HTML file using the script tag, to make the calculator functional.
Make sure that both files are in the same directory, otherwise you have to provide the correct file path for the CSS and JavaScript files in the respective tags.
